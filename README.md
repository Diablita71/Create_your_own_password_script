"# Create_your_own_password_script" 

generate password. py file is the original code by 
collinsmc23/cybersec-info-automation-scripts
the course project file is the one i modify
i wanted to create a different way to create passwords by using words that will help us remember passwords
I still wanted to used the length and used any word that you want to help you remember passwords more easily but still creating a strong password.
